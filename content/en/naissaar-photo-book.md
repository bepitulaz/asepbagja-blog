I love taking photos on the street or in nature. I usually post the result on social media sites such as [Instagram](https://instagram.com/bepitulaz), Twitter, or Facebook. Sometimes I also submit it on more specific photography sites like [500px](https://500px.com/p/asepbagja?view=photos) or [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/@asepbagja). But, I have felt bored showcasing my photographs in that way. I need a different way to showcase my pictures.

In the last summer of 2022, I took online photography courses to broaden my knowledge in that area. The course taught me about showcasing photos. Not only by using social media but also by printing it into a book. By making a book and arranging pictures in a sequence, I can tell the story and the journey behind it.

I decided to make my first photo book project from my September bicycle ride in Naissaar. Naissaar is an island northwest of Tallinn, Estonia. I carefully curated all pictures, arranged them into a sequence, and designed the photo book layout. Moreover, I also hired my friend to be my content writer and editor. She wrote an introduction text and some picture descriptions.

In the end, I distribute the book in digital format too. So, you can also enjoy it easily. You can buy it from [Amazon Kindle](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BKQVXR7Z/ref=cm_sw_em_r_mt_dp_CZHBC14NSS1AVABDBE5B), [Apple Books](http://books.apple.com/us/book/id6444045103), and [Gumroad](https://chloematt.gumroad.com/l/naissaar-photobook). There is a free sample of the book on Amazon Kindle and Apple Books.

*P.s. if you want the printed version, you can order it by mailing me at [asep@chloematt.com](mailto:asep@chloematt.com). I can print it on demand. The printed version is the best experience to enjoy all pictures.*
