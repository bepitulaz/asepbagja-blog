_A letter from my dad about how to make my company bigger._

My dad was a government auditor for 35 years plus. He never expected me to be an entrepreneur. At the first, he did not support me, but now he is the one who regularly give me advices about running a company.

A few days ago, he sent me an email (in Bahasa Indonesia) that I thought it was a very good advice and I would like to share it to another startup founder. Here is the email which I translate into English.

With bigger (startup) organization size and scalability, there's no reason for not accepting the corporate culture._

For product development, it is very good approach. But when the company turns to be a mature company, the company culture should turns to be mature also. When the size of the company is getting bigger and bigger, the line of products or service is getting more, and the number of clients or users is increasing, that's the moment to adopt the corporate culture into the company. Of course, you'll get conflicts in every aspect in the company. Moreover if many people are involved in it, e.g. investors and employees, but this is an adjustment that the company need. Corporate culture will help you to control the operation of the company to be more efficient and stay effective, also it can secure your company asset._

And indeed, many associates oppress one another, except for those who believe and do righteous deeds - and few are they." And David became certain that We had tried him, and he asked forgiveness of his Lord and fell down bowing [in prostration] and turned in repentance [to Allah ]. - Quran surah Saad:24_

Embracing the corporate culture will become an important step to bring your company into higher level._

The last sentence is very bold. You want to be a startup forever or go into higher level. Thanks, my dad.
