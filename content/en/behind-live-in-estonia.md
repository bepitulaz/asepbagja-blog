Photography, especially landscape and street photography, is my hobby besides music production. I bring a mirrorless camera, Sony A6000, almost every day wherever I go. This hobby escalated since I moved to Estonia in October 2021. Living in a new country with beautiful nature makes me more excited to take photos. The problem is, what will I do for that photos?

Uploading it to the Internet is the definite answer. The easy solution is to upload it to Instagram. Of course, I did that. But, I'm not a person who trusts 3rd party social media platforms to upload all my works. I started prioritising my domain as <a href="https://www.asepbagja.com/personal/going-back-to-personal-web" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">my house of content in 2019</a> rather than posting it on social media platforms. Furthermore, I like the <a href="https://indieweb.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IndieWeb</a> concept, "your content is yours, and you are in control."

Because of that reason, I casually searched for a .com domain name related to Estonia in <a href="https://namecheap.pxf.io/x9Pgmx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Namecheap</a> a few weeks ago. I need a domain to be a place for all the photos that I take almost every week. Lucky, I found an available good domain name <a href="https://www.liveinestonia.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">liveinestonia.com</a>.

After buying the domain, I started to develop the website. The goal was to make it as cheap as possible, even better if I could make it free of cost. The first option was using WordPress to avoid coding effort. But, I couldn't find free WordPress hosting. So, the tradeoff was no coding effort, but I had to pay for the hosting.

No, I won't go for that option. So, I chose to code my blog engine as simple as possible so that I could host it for free. There is a lot of free hosting for a static website. That's why I must use a tool that can produce a static site with which I'm already familiar to avoid a learning curve.

My choice of technology stack was Next.js as the static site generator, Google Photos as the content management system (CMS), and I hosted it in Vercel. With that technology stack, I didn't spend additional money to operate the website besides the domain and Google Photos. I already have Google One subscription for a year which includes Google Photos. Moreover, I open-sourced my photo blog engine if you want to use it. You can visit and fork <a href="http://github.com/bepitulaz/live-in-estonia" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the GitHub repository</a>.

Finally, enjoy my photography works on the Live In Estonia website. You can contact me if you have an exciting project and want to collaborate with me.
